# ALXprodev-advanced_git

This repository demonstrates the setup and usage of **GitFlow** as part of the ALX ProDev Advanced Git module.

## Objectives

- Initialize a GitFlow workflow
- Use the `develop` branch for integration
- Apply GitFlow default configurations
- Practice structured Git branching

## GitFlow Setup

GitFlow was initialized using default settings:

```bash
git flow init -d

This sets:

main as the production branch

develop as the integration branch

Default prefixes for feature, release, and hotfix branches

Repository Structure

main – Production-ready code

develop – Ongoing development

README.md – Project documentation
